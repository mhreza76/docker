## Don,t Ignore .dockerignore
The `.dockerignore` file is used by Docker to specify files and directories that should be excluded (ignored) when building a Docker image. It works similarly to the more widely known `.gitignore` file used by Git to specify files and directories that should be ignored when tracking changes.

Here's how it works:

- Default Behavior: By default, Docker includes all files and directories in the build context when building an image.
- Use of .dockerignore: If a file named .dockerignore is present in the build context, Docker reads it to determine which files and directories should be excluded from the build context.
- Exclusion Rules: The .dockerignore file follows the same rules as .gitignore. You can use wildcards and patterns to specify files and directories to be excluded.

For example, a .dockerignore file might look like this:
```
# .dockerignore
# Exclude the Dockerfile
Dockerfile
# Exclude the README.md file
README.md
# Exclude the .env file
.env
# Exclude the .git file
.git
```
