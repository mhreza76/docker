## Docker Image Layer
In Docker, images are composed of multiple layers. A docker container image is created using a dockerfile. Every line in a dockerfile will create a layer.
If you make changes to your Dockerfile and rebuild the image, Docker can reuse cached layers to speed up the process, only rebuilding the layers affected by the changes.  Caching plays a significant role in optimizing the build process.

**Install Dive**
The dive is a command line tool for analyzing a Docker image. This tool shows image contents broken down by layer. It can used to explore image structure in order to minimize size of Docker image. [Reference](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive)

Install dive on Ubuntu
`sudo snap install dive`

Uninstall dive
`sudo apt purge --autoremove -y dive`
