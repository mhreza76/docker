## Docker volume:

Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. They provide a way to share data between containers and also to persist data even if the container is removed.\

Here are some common Docker volume-related commands with examples:

List of Docker Volume.
`docker volume ls`

Create Docker volume.
`docker volume create my_volume`

List of Docker Volume.
`docker volume ls`

Inspect a Volume.
`docker volume inspect my_volume`

Remove a Volume.
`docker volume rm my_volume`

Create Nginx volume and run Nginx Pod with attached volume inside of Nginx Pod.\
```bash
docker volume create web-data
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name nginx-server -v web-data:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
```
Login into container and update index.html and check data is persist, after update container data check host machine volume.
```bash
docker volume ls
docker inspect web-data
sudo su root
cd /var/snap/docker/common/var-lib-docker/volumes/web-data/_data
cat index.html
```

**Let's go through examples of anonymous volumes, named volumes, and bind mounts in Docker.**

1. Anonymous Volume:
Anonymous volumes are volumes without a specific name. They are created by Docker and associated with the container that uses them.
```bash
# Run Nginx container with an anonymous volume
docker run -d --name anonymous-nginx -v /usr/share/nginx/html nginx

# Check the volume details
docker inspect anonymous-nginx
```
In this example, the anonymous volume is automatically created for the default Nginx HTML path (/usr/share/nginx/html). It will be removed when the container is removed.

2. Named Volume:
Named volumes are explicitly created with a specific name, allowing for reusability and persistence.
```bash
docker volume create web-data
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name nginx-server -v web-data:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
```
Here, the named volume `web-data` is created, and it is mounted to the default Nginx HTML path `(/usr/share/nginx/html)` inside the named-nginx container.

3. Bind Mount:
Bind mounts allow you to mount a directory from the host machine into the container.
```
# Run a container with a bind mount
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name bind-mount -v /home/nasir/bind-mount:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx

# Check the volume details
docker inspect bind-mount
```
In this case, the `/home/nasir/bind-mount` directory on the host machine is mounted into the default Nginx HTML path `(/usr/share/nginx/html)` inside the bind-nginx container.
