##  Difference between CMD vs ENTRYPOINT Docker!

In Docker, both `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` are instructions used to specify what command should be run when a container is started.
You can write Docker CMD/ENTRYPOINT instructions in both forms:

- CMD echo "Hello World" (shell form)
- CMD ["echo", "Hello World"] (exec form)
- ENTRYPOINT echo "Hello World" (shell form)
- ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Hello World"] (exec form)

**Docker CMD**
- Whenever we want to override executable while running the container, use `CMD`.
- We can override the value with a command-line argument.
- We can multiple CMD in a single docker file but only one will be executable while the container start.

Let’s see an example.
`vi Dockerfile`
```bash
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
CMD ["echo", "Hello World"]
```
Build and run the docker file.
`docker build -t ubuntu-test .`
`docker run -it ubuntu-test`

*Here, we have passed as parameter Hello World for CMD that prints after container start. Here, we overrode the default value with Hi!*
`docker run -it ubuntu-test echo "Hi!"`

*In a Dockerfile, only the last CMD instruction is effective. If there are multiple CMD instructions, the last one will override the previous ones.*

**Docker Entrypoint**
- Just like with CMD, you need to specify a command and parameters.
- You cannot override the ENTRYPOINT instruction by adding command-line parameters to the docker run command.

We will also see an example.
`vi Dockerfile`
```bash
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Hello Google"]
```
Build and run the docker file.
`docker build -t ubuntu-test .`

`docker run -it ubuntu-test`

It worked the same as CMD but when we have passed parameters will be see difference.
`docker run -it ubuntu-test:latest "Hello from AWS"`

*we have passed parameters but the executable hasn’t overridden and also added a new parameter with the old parameter.*

**Now, let’s see how to use CMD and Entrypoint together.**

Modify our existing Dockerfile so it includes both `CMD & ENTRYPOINT`instructions.
```bash
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Hello"]
CMD ["Google World"]
```
Build a new image from the modified Dockerfile and run a container.
`docker build -t ubuntu-test .`
`docker run -it ubuntu-test:latest`

*It will print the message `Hello Google World` message*

Let's pass parameters to the docker run command.
`docker run -it ubuntu-test  Bangladesh`

*The output has now changed to `Hello Bangladesh`*

**Conclusion**
- Whenever there is a chance of overriding executable while running the container using CMD otherwise uses ENTRYPOINT.
- Sometimes we don’t have to override the executable all we want to run the container, in that case, ENTRYPOINT is the best use case.
- If ENTRYPOINT is used for the executable, we can use CMD to pass default parameters. In that case, we use both together.
