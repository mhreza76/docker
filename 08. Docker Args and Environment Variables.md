## Docker Args & Environment Variables

ARG and ENV are dockerfile instructions, which you can apply the different configurations.

ARG parameters are applied only during the docker image building process they are unavailable once you have built the image.
Default values can be specified for ARG parameters in the Dockerfile, and they can be modified during image creation.

You can pass ENV variables not only during the image building but also at runtime when your containers are running.
ENV can also have a default value in the dockerfile and you can override ENV values.
